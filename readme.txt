== Description ==

This plugin is a small logger of site visits. It registers all the users that enter to visit the site, and stores them in a database. These records can be viewed from the administration panel from a simple interface.

Once installed, a new item called visitors will appear in the administration panel, which is what allows us to enter the plugin. From it we can see what the visits have been today, yesterday, this week, this month or this year.

The main feature of this plugin is its simplicity, which makes its installation and use very simple, unlike other plugins or systems that can be much more complex.

== Installation ==
